# Trending Videos Case Study

Deliverable

This afternoon your group will present your results to the class from the README in your Github repository. Your README markdown file should:

* Clearly state the goal of your project (what were you exploring?)

* Describe the data.

  * What features (columns) did you have to work with?
  * What features were you interested in?
  * Were the features numerical/categorical/text?
  * Was a lot of data missing? If so, what did you do to handle it?
  * How did features relate to each other, and the values that you were interested in?
  * Pictures are worth 1000s of words!
